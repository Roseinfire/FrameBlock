# Intro
### Chrome Extension which block frames
Did you know advertisements take up to 40% of your screen? <br>
Various frames pop-up here and there making content even `unreadable` <br>
FrameBlock does the following contributions:
* remove frames
* remove banners
* remove shadow content
* keep your screen clean and safety
# Installation
* Download Zip Code
* Extract Folder
* Open Google Chrome
* Go to chrome://extensions
* Enable Developer Mode
* Click 'Load Unpacked'
* Select Extracted Folder
### Ready, now go to the internet!
# Conception
Stupid advertisements always use the same patterns. <br>
Far more, some of those methods are always used only by stupid advertisements. <br>
That's why FrameBlock was created. Just remove patterns. <br>
FrameBlock is not an adBlock, but it blocks a great part of heavy and harmful advertisements. <br>
# Dark side
As explained above, FrameBlock does not block the advertisement. <br>
It blocks patterns, which are potentially harmful. <br>
So, some sites will work incorrectly: 
  * Youtube
  * Google Drive
  * Github
  * Lichess
### What's wrong?
Their content becomes less interactive or less useful. <br>
Google Drive unable to download files, Github will not show the icons. <br>
### Solution:
It's best to disable FrameBlock on Trusted Sites, but keep enabled by default.
