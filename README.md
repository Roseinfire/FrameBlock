# Intro

Did you know advertisements take up to 40% of your screen? <br>
Various frames pop-up here and there making content even `unreadable` <br>
FrameBlock does the following contributions:

# Advantages
FrameBlock `protects` from unwanted parts of web content. <br>
Websites always become more readable and more safe. <br>
Protection accesses you quickly search information and don't worry about harmful content. <br>
Frameblock works `where usual` adblocks are `powerless`
# Problems
We are weekly updating our list of trusted sites, but it's impossible to know them all. <br>

Don't worry, you can report the problem if it is worth so.
